 If you have elements of a single type (all acoustic, all elastic, all poroelast
 ic, and without CPML)
 in the whole mesh, then there should be no significant imbalance in the above n
 umbers.
 Otherwise, it is normal to have imbalance in elements and points because the do
 main decomposer
 compensates for the different cost of different elements by partitioning them u
 nevenly among processes.

 Time step #       120000
 Time:    239.9980      seconds
 Elapsed time in seconds =    115572.608965874     
 Elapsed time in hh:mm:ss =     32 h 06 m 12 s
 Mean elapsed time per time step in seconds =   0.9631051    
 Max norm displacement vector U in all slices (m) =   3.5000907E-04
 Time steps done =       120000  out of       120000
 Time steps remaining =            0
 Estimated remaining time in seconds =   0.0000000E+00
 Estimated remaining time in hh:mm:ss =      0 h 00 m 00 s
