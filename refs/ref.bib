abstract = {The dependence of the amplitude spectrum of seismic waves on source size is investigated on the basis of two dislocation models of an earthquake source. One of the models (by N. Haskell) is called the ω³ model, and the other, called the ω² model, is constructed by fitting an exponentially decaying function to the autocorrelation function of the dislocation velocity. The number of source parameters is reduced to one by the assumption of similarity. We found that the most convenient parameter for our purpose is the magnitude Ms, defined for surface waves with period of 20 sec. Spectral density curves are determined for given Ms. Comparison of the theoretical curves with observations is made in two different ways. The observed ratios of the spectra of seismic waves with the same propagation path but from earthquakes of different sizes are compared with the corresponding theoretical ratios, thereby eliminating the effect of propagation on the spectrum. The other method is to check the theory with the empirical relation between different magnitude scales defined for different waves at different periods. The ω² model gives a satisfactory agreement with such observations on the assumption of similarity, but the ω³ model does not. We find, however, some indications of departure from similarity. The efficiency of seismic radiation seems to increase with decreasing magnitude if the Gutenberg-Richter magnitude-energy relation is valid. The assumption of similarity implies a constant stress drop independent of source size. A preliminary study of Love waves from the Parkfield earthquake of June 28, 1966, shows that the stress drop at the source of this earthquake is lower than the normal value (around 100 bars) by about 2 orders of magnitude.},

    abstract = {New empirical traveltime curves for the major seismic phases have been derived from the catalogues of the International Seismological Centre by relocating events by using P readings, depth phases and the iasp91 traveltimes, and then re-associating phase picks. A smoothed set of traveltime tables is extracted by a robust procedure which gives estimates of the variance of the traveltimes for each phase branch. This set of smoothed empirical times is then used to construct a range of radial velocity profiles, which are assessed against a number of different measures of the level of fit between the empirical times and the predictions of the models. These measures are constructed from weighted sums of L2 misfits for individual phases. The weights are chosen to provide a measure of the probable reliability of the picks for the different phases.A preferred model, ak135, is proposed which gives a significantly better fit to a broad range of phases than is provided by the iasp91 and sp6 models. The differences in velocity between ak135 and these models are generally quite small except at the boundary of the inner core, where reduced velocity gradients are needed to achieve satisfactory performance for PKP differential time data.The potential resolution of velocity structure has been assessed with the aid of a non-linear search procedure in which 5000 models have been generated in bounds about ak135. Misfit calculations are performed for each of the phases in the empirical traveltime sets, and the models are then sorted using different overall measures of misfit. The best 100 models for each criterion are displayed in a model density plot which indicates the consistency of the different models. The interaction of information from different phases can be analysed by comparing the different misfit measures. Structure in the mantle is well resolved except at the base, and ak135 provides a good representation of core velocities.},

    abstract = {We present an introduction to the spectral element method, which provides an innovative numerical approach to the calculation of synthetic seismograms in 3-D earth models. The method combines the flexibility of a finite element method with the accuracy of a spectral method. One uses a weak formulation of the equations of motion, which are solved on a mesh of hexahedral elements that is adapted to the free surface and to the main internal discontinuities of the model. The wavefield on the elements is discretized using high-degree Lagrange interpolants, and integration over an element is accomplished based upon the Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre integration rule. This combination of discretization and integration results in a diagonal mass matrix, which greatly simplifies the algorithm. We illustrate the great potential of the method by comparing it to a discrete wavenumber/reflectivity method for layer-cake models. Both body and surface waves are accurately represented, and the method can handle point force as well as moment tensor sources. For a model with very steep surface topography we successfully benchmark the method against an approximate boundary technique. For a homogeneous medium with strong attenuation we obtain excellent agreement with the analytical solution for a point force.},

The technique solves a weak formulation of the wave equation, which is discretized using a high‐order polynomial representation on a finite element mesh. For isotropic media, the spectral element method is known for its high degree of accuracy, its ability to handle complex model geometries, and its low computational cost. We show that the method can be extended to fully anisotropic media. The mass matrix obtained is diagonal by construction, which leads to a very efficient fully explicit solver. We demonstrate the accuracy of the method by comparing it against a known analytical solution for a 2-D transversely isotropic test case, and by comparing its predictions against those based upon a finite difference method for a 2-D heterogeneous, anisotropic medium. We show its generality and its flexibility by modeling wave propagation in a 3-D transversely isotropic medium with a symmetry axis tilted relative to the axes of the grid. }

The method is based upon a weak formulation of the equations of motion and combines the flexibility of a finite-element method with the accuracy of a global pseudospectral method. The finite-element mesh honours all first- and second-order discontinuities in the earth model. To maintain a relatively constant resolution throughout the model in terms of the number of grid points per wavelength, the size of the elements is increased with depth in a conforming fashion, thus retaining a diagonal mass matrix. In the Earth's mantle and inner core we solve the wave equation in terms of displacement, whereas in the liquid outer core we use a formulation based upon a scalar potential. The three domains are matched at the inner core and core–mantle boundaries, honouring the continuity of traction and the normal component of velocity. The effects of attenuation and anisotropy are fully incorporated. The method is implemented on a parallel computer using a message passing technique. We benchmark spectral-element synthetic seismograms against normal-mode synthetics for a spherically symmetric reference model. The two methods are in excellent agreement for all body- and surface-wave arrivals with periods greater than about 20 s.},

We include the full complexity of 3-D Earth models, i.e. lateral variations in compressional-wave velocity, shear-wave velocity and density, a 3-D crustal model, ellipticity, as well as topography and bathymetry. We also include the effects of the oceans, rotation and self-gravitation in the context of the Cowling approximation. For the oceans we introduce a formulation based upon an equivalent load in which the oceans do not need to be meshed explicitly. Some of these effects, which are often considered negligible in global seismology, can in fact play a significant role for certain source-receiver configurations. Anisotropy and attenuation, which were introduced and validated in a previous paper, are also incorporated in this study. The complex phenomena that are taken into account are introduced in such a way that we preserve the main advantages of the spectral-element method, which are an exactly diagonal mass matrix and very high computational efficiency on parallel computers. For self-gravitation and the oceans we benchmark spectral-element synthetic seismograms against normal-mode synthetics for the spherically symmetric reference model PREM. The two methods are in excellent agreement for all body- and surface-wave arrivals with periods greater than about 20 s in the case of self-gravitation and 25 s in the case of the oceans. At long periods the effect of gravity on multiorbit surface waves up to R4 is correctly reproduced. We subsequently present results of simulations for two real earthquakes in fully 3-D Earth models for which the fit to the data is significantly improved compared with classical normal-mode calculations based upon PREM. For example, we show that for trans-Pacific paths the Rayleigh wave can arrive more than a minute earlier than in PREM, and that the Love wave is much shorter in duration.},

On average, PP/P is ∼10\% higher than predicted by the Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM) when PP surface-reflection points are within continental regions, and ∼10\% lower than PREM predictions for oceanic reflection points. Spectral-element synthetics show that this variation can be attributed mostly to the effect of crustal thickness on the long-period PP reflection coefficient. The anomalies of SS/S are similar in amplitude but their geographic variation does not obviously correlate with ocean/continent variations. The variation of SS/S determined from spectral-element waveforms of S and SS for 3-D models of the crust and mantle is similar to the observed variation of SS/S. This suggests that wave propagation effects are largely responsible for the observed SS/S variation, not only intrinsic attenuation.},

abstract={A spectral element method has been recently developed for solving elastodynamic problems. The numerical solutions are obtained by using the weak formulation of the elastodynamic equation for heterogeneous media, based on the Galerkin approach applied to a partition, in small subdomains, of the original physical domain. In this work, some mathematical aspects of the method and the associated algorithm implementation are systematically investigated. Two kinds of orthogonal basis functions, constructed with Legendre and Chebyshev polynomials, and their related Gauss-Lobatto collocation points are introduced. The related integration formulas are obtained. The standard error estimations and expansion convergence are discussed. An element-by-element pre-conditioned conjugate gradient linear solver in the space domain and a staggered predictor-multi-corrector algorithm in the time integration are used for strong heterogeneous elastic media. As a consequence, neither the global matrices nor the effective force vector is assembled. When analytical formulas are used for the element quadrature, there is even no need for forming element matrix in order to further save memory without losing much in computational efficiency. The element-by-element algorithm uses an optimal tensor product scheme which makes this method much more efficient than finite-element methods from the point of view of both memory storage and computational time requirements. This work is divided into two parts. The first part mainly focuses on theoretical studies with a simple numerical result for the Chebyshev spectral element, and the second part, mainly with the Legendre spectral element, will give the algorithm implementation, numerical accuracy and efficiency analyses, and then the detailed modeling example comparisons of the proposed spectral element method with a pseudo-spectral method, which will be seen in another work by Lin, Wang and Zhang.},

abstract = {We present a review of the application of the spectral-element method to regional and global seismology. This technique is a high-order variational method that allows one to compute accurate synthetic seismograms in three-dimensional heterogeneous Earth models with deformed geometry. We first recall the strong and weak forms of the seismic wave equation with a particular emphasis set on fluid regions. We then discuss in detail how the conditions that hold on the boundaries, including coupling boundaries, are honored. We briefly outline the spectral-element discretization procedure and present the time-marching algorithm that makes use of the diagonal structure of the mass matrix. We show examples that illustrate the capabilities of the method and its interest in the context of the computation of three-dimensional synthetic seismograms.}

    abstract = {We present a derivation of the equations describing wave propagation in porous media based upon an averaging technique which accommodates the transition from the microscopic to the macroscopic scale. We demonstrate that the governing macroscopic equations determined by Biot remain valid for media with gradients in porosity. In such media, the well-known expression for the change in porosity, or the change in the fluid content of the pores, acquires two extra terms involving the porosity gradient. One fundamental result of Biot's theory is the prediction of a second compressional wave, often referred to as ‘type II’ or ‘Biot's slow compressional wave’, in addition to the classical fast compressional and shear waves. We present a numerical implementation of the Biot equations for 2-D problems based upon the spectral-element method (SEM) that clearly illustrates the existence of these three types of waves as well as their interactions at discontinuities. As in the elastic and acoustic cases, poroelastic wave propagation based upon the SEM involves a diagonal mass matrix, which leads to explicit time integration schemes that are well suited to simulations on parallel computers. Effects associated with physical dispersion and attenuation and frequency-dependent viscous resistance are accommodated based upon a memory variable approach. We perform various benchmarks involving poroelastic wave propagation and acoustic–poroelastic and poroelastic–poroelastic discontinuities, and we discuss the boundary conditions used to deal with these discontinuities based upon domain decomposition. We show potential applications of the method related to wave propagation in compacted sediments, as one encounters in the petroleum industry, and to detect the seismic signature of buried landmines and unexploded ordnance.},

Contrary to many finite-element implementations, ours is implemented successfully in single precision, maximizing the performance of current generation GPUs. We discuss the implementation and optimization of the code and compare it to an existing very optimized implementation in C language and MPI on a classical cluster of CPU nodes. We use mesh coloring to efficiently handle summation operations over degrees of freedom on an unstructured mesh, and non-blocking MPI messages in order to overlap the communications across the network and the data transfer to and from the device via PCIe with calculations on the GPU. We perform a number of numerical tests to validate the single-precision CUDA and MPI implementation and assess its accuracy.

The structure and seismotectonic setting of the region are poorly understood, although the area is highly populated and important infrastructures are planned there. New seismic reflection data have identified a number of faults, as well as a crustal scale NE-trending anticline few km north of the strait. These features are interpreted as due to active right-lateral transpression along the north-eastern Sicilian offshore, coexisting with extensional and right-lateral transtensional tectonics in the southern Messina Strait. This complex tectonic network appears to be controlled by independent and overlapping tectonic settings, due to the presence of a diffuse transfer zone between the SE-ward retreating Calabria subduction zone relative to slab advance in the western Sicilian side.},

    abstract = {We present a new 3-D transversely isotropic shear wave velocity model of the European and Mediterranean upper mantle obtained by analysis of surface waves. Data used are fundamental-mode Rayleigh and Love group velocity measurements in the period range 35–170 s, taken on seismograms recorded by European stations for regional earthquakes. The tomographic inversion to map the 3-D earth structure is split into two steps. First, we regionalize the group velocity dispersion measurements, obtaining distinct geographical group velocity maps at different periods; then, each local dispersion curve is inverted separately to find the shear wave velocity structure at depth. The inversion benefits from using a priori information from a 3-D global mantle model (S20RTS) and a new detailed European crustal model (EPcrust) to constrain the shallower layers. The inversion scheme follows a non-linear iterative algorithm by which Rayleigh and Love group slowness are inverted simultaneously for the best-fitting isotropic Voigt shear wave speed  and radial anisotropy parameter (vSH−vSV). Final merging of the vS profiles results in a new higher resolution 3-D model of European upper mantle. We find that Western Europe and Mediterranean Sea are mainly characterized by relatively low velocities, strongly contrasting with the fast roots of the Eastern European Craton. Many regional scale structures are also evident in the model, thus providing insights into the complex geodynamic framework of the European continent. Most prominent are the low-velocity West Mediterranean spreading basins and European Cenozoic rift system, and seismically fast features connected to subduction of Adria microplate, Hellenic Arc and Calabrian Arc. Radial anisotropy does not vary very significantly with respect to the PREM profile, as available data only resolve lateral variations to a limited degree due to trade-off with velocity. EPmantle has the potential to provide a reliable seismological reference for the upper-mantle structure in the broad European region.},

abstract = {Seismic tomography has been a vital tool in probing the Earth's internal structure and enhancing our knowledge of dynamical processes in the Earth's crust and mantle. While various tomographic techniques differ in data types utilized (e.g., body vs. surface waves), data sensitivity (ray vs. finite-frequency approximations), and choices of model parameterization and regularization, most global mantle tomographic models agree well at long wavelengths, owing to the presence and typical dimensions of cold subducted oceanic lithospheres and hot, ascending mantle plumes (e.g., in central Pacific and Africa). Structures at relatively small length scales remain controversial, though, as will be discussed in this paper, they are becoming increasingly resolvable with the fast expanding global and regional seismic networks and improved forward modeling and inversion techniques. This review paper aims to provide an overview of classical tomography methods, key debates pertaining to the resolution of mantle tomographic models, as well as to highlight recent theoretical and computational advances in forward-modeling methods that spearheaded the developments in accurate computation of sensitivity kernels and adjoint tomography. The first part of the paper is devoted to traditional traveltime and waveform tomography. While these approaches established a firm foundation for global and regional seismic tomography, data coverage and the use of approximate sensitivity kernels remained as key limiting factors in the resolution of the targeted structures. In comparison to classical tomography, adjoint tomography takes advantage of full 3D numerical simulations in forward modeling and, in many ways, revolutionizes the seismic imaging of heterogeneous structures with strong velocity contrasts. For this reason, this review provides details of the implementation, resolution and potential challenges of adjoint tomography. Further discussions of techniques that are presently popular in seismic array analysis, such as noise correlation functions, receiver functions, inverse scattering imaging, and the adaptation of adjoint tomography to these different datasets highlight the promising future of seismic tomography.}

We model the propagation of seismic waves using our recently developed direct solution method/spectral-element method hybrid technique, which allows us to simulate the propagation of short-period teleseismic waves through a regional 3-D model. We implement an iterative quasi-Newton method based upon the L-BFGS algorithm, where the gradient of the misfit function is computed using the adjoint-state method. Compared to gradient or conjugate-gradient methods, the L-BFGS algorithm has a much faster convergence rate. We illustrate the potential of this method on a synthetic test case that consists of a crustal model with a crustal discontinuity at 25 km depth and a sharp Moho jump. This model contains short- and long-wavelength heterogeneities along the lateral and vertical directions. The iterative inversion starts from a smooth 1-D model derived from the IASP91 reference Earth model. We invert both radial and vertical component waveforms, starting from long-period signals filtered at 10 s and gradually decreasing the cut-off period down to 1.25 s. This multiscale algorithm quickly converges towards a model that is very close to the true model, in contrast to inversions involving short-period waveforms only, which always get trapped into a local minimum of the cost function.},

    abstract = {Reaching the global minimum of a waveform misfit function requires careful choices about the nonlinear optimization, preconditioning and regularization methods underlying an inversion. Because waveform inversion problems are susceptible to erratic convergence associated with strong nonlinearity, one or two test cases are not enough to reliably inform such decisions. We identify best practices, instead, using four seismic near-surface problems, one regional problem and two global problems. To make meaningful quantitative comparisons between methods, we carry out hundreds of inversions, varying one aspect of the implementation at a time. Comparing nonlinear optimization algorithms, we find that limited-memory BFGS provides computational savings over nonlinear conjugate gradient methods in a wide range of test cases. Comparing preconditioners, we show that a new diagonal scaling derived from the adjoint of the forward operator provides better performance than two conventional preconditioning schemes. Comparing regularization strategies, we find that projection, convolution, Tikhonov regularization and total variation regularization are effective in different contexts. Besides questions of one strategy or another, reliability and efficiency in waveform inversion depend on close numerical attention and care. Implementation details involving the line search and restart conditions have a strong effect on computational cost, regardless of the chosen nonlinear optimization algorithm.},

abstract={A detailed 3D image of the Calabro-Ionian subduction system in the central Mediterranean was obtained by means of a seismic tomography, exploiting a large dataset of local earthquakes and computing algorithms able to build a dense grid of measure nodes. Results show that the slab is continuous below the southern sector of the Calabro-Peloritan Arc, but the deformation processes developing at its edges are leading to its progressive narrowing, influencing tectonics and magmatism at the surface, and with possible stress concentration in the tip zones. In the southwest, the deformation occurring at a free slab edge lead to propagation of a vertical lithospheric tear in the overriding plate, which extends along a NW-SE fault system (Aeolian-Tindari-Letojanni) up to about 30 km into the Ionian Sea; further southeast, the lithosphere appears only flexed and not broken yet. In the northeast, the slab seems to break progressively, parallel to the trench. Finally, northwest of Mt. Etna, the tomography highlights low VP that can be related to an upwelling of deep mantle material likely flowing laterally through a window opened by the complete slab detachment.},

The domain discretization is based on the spectral element method with Gauss–Lobatto–Legendre (GLL) collocation points, whereas the time discretization is based on the explicit leapfrog scheme. As usual, GLL points are also employed in the numerical quadrature, so that the mass matrix is diagonal and the resulting algebraic scheme is explicit in time. The analysis provides an a priori estimate which depends on the time step, the element length, and the polynomial degree, generalizing several known results for the wave equation in homogeneous media. Numerical examples illustrate the validity of the estimate under certain regularity assumptions and provide expected error estimates when the medium is discontinuous.}

As a cross-platform tool producing high-quality maps and figures, it is used by tens of thousands of scientists around the world. The basic syntax of GMT scripts has evolved very slowly since the 1990s, despite the fact that GMT is generally perceived to have a steep learning curve with many pitfalls for beginners and experienced users alike. Reducing these pitfalls means changing the interface, which would break compatibility with thousands of existing scripts. With the latest GMT version 6, we solve this conundrum by introducing a new “modern mode” to complement the interface used in previous versions, which GMT 6 now calls “classic mode.” GMT 6 defaults to classic mode and thus is a recommended upgrade for all GMT 5 users. Nonetheless, new users should take advantage of modern mode to make shorter scripts, quickly access commonly used global data sets, and take full advantage of the new tools to draw subplots, place insets, and create animations.},

Relying on geological observations (wells, dredges, and dives) and seismic calibrations from the surrounding platforms and escarpments, we present age correlations for the deepest sedimentary sequences of the Ionian Basin. Two-ship deep refraction seismic data combined with reprocessed reflection seismic data enable us to identify, characterize, and map these thick sedimentary sequences and to present a consistent seismic stratigraphy across the basin. At a larger scale, we present new geological transects illustrating the tectonostratigraphic relationships between the Ionian Basin and its surrounding rifted margins. On this basis, we suggest that a Late Triassic-Early Jurassic rifting preceded the late Early Jurassic to Middle Jurassic formation of the Ionian Basin. The combination of geophysical and geological arguments suggests that the entire deep basin is floored with oceanic crust of normal thickness, but with high seismic velocity in the upper part. Upscaling our results in the framework of the eastern Mediterranean, we propose that the Ionian Basin represents the remnant of a short-lived oceanic basin resulting from the interaction between two propagating oceans: the Central Atlantic and the Neo-Tethys.},

We have developed an opern-source package that allows us to inject either an incident plane wave, computed with a frequency–wavenumber method, or the complete wavefield, computed in a spherically symmetric reference earth model with AxiSEM. The computations inside the regional spectral-element grid are performed with SPECFEM3DCartesian. We compare the efficiency and reliability of the two injection methods for teleseismic P waves, considering a wide range of epicentral distance and hypocentral depths. Our simulations demonstrate that in practice the effects of wave front and Earth curvature are negligible for moderate size regional domains (several hundreds of kilometres) and for periods larger than 2 s. The main differences observed in synthetic seismograms are related to secondary phases that have a different slowness from the one of the reference P phase.},

These techniques are used in geophysics (geophysical interpretation, subsoil imaging, development of new methods of exploration), seismology (study of earthquakes, regional and global seismology, accurate calculation of synthetic seismograms), in the development of new methods for ultrasonic diagnostics in materials science (non-destructive methods) and medicine (acoustic tomography). In this paper we present a review of numerical methods that have been developed and are currently used. In particular we review the key concepts and pioneering ideas behind finite-difference methods, pseudospectral methods, finite-volume methods, Galerkin continuous and discontinuous finite-element methods (classical or based on spectral interpolation), and still others such as physics-compatible, and multiscale methods. We focus on their formulations in time domain along with the main temporal discretization schemes. We present the theory and implementation for some of these methods. Moreover, their computational characteristics are evaluated in order to aid the choice of the method for each practical situation.},

We choose the North Island, New Zealand as a study area because of its high seismicity, extensive seismic network, and the availability of a candidate ray tomography starting model. To assess the accuracy of this model, we simulated 250 regional earthquakes using a spectral element solver, and compared the resulting synthetics with recorded waveforms. In a 10–30 s passband, reasonable cross-correlation phase and amplitude misfits exist between data and synthetics, whereas at 2–30 s, waveform misalignment is severe enough that meaningful cross-correlation measurements are no longer possible. To improve the velocity model at these short periods, we created an automated inversion framework based on existing tools for signal processing, phase measurement, nonlinear optimization, and workflow management. To verify the inversion framework, we performed a realistic synthetic inversion for 3-D checkerboard structure and analyzed model recovery, misfit reduction, and waveform improvement. The results of this analysis show that the source–receiver distribution within the chosen domain is capable of resolving velocity anomalies in regions of sufficient data coverage, and of magnitudes comparable to those expected in a real seismic inversion. Along with this finding, the relative ease of use and reliability of the workflow motivates future efforts targeting a high-resolution (2–30 s), large-scale (\&gt;50 000 measurements) seismic inversion for the North Island. Updated models from such an inversion are expected to improve ground motion predictions, constrain complex velocity structures, and advance understanding of New Zealand tectonics.},

By adapting the mesh to the expected complexity and smoothness of the wavefield, the number of elements needed to discretize the wave equation can be greatly reduced. This leads to spectral-element meshes which are optimally tailored to source locations and medium complexity. We demonstrate a workflow which opens up the possibility to use these meshes in FWI and show the computational advantages of the approach.

As a case study for extensive numerical simulations we consider the magnitude 7 seismic event of the 30th of October 2020 taking place in the Icarian Sea (Greece) and the Tahtalı dam around 30km from there (Turkey). A challenging task is to resolve the multiple length scales that are present due to the huge differences in size between the dam building structure and the area of interest, considered for the propagation of the earthquake. Interfaces between structures and highly non-conforming meshes on different scales are resolved by means of a discontinuous Galerkin approach. The seismic source is modeled using inversion data about the real fault plane. Ultimately, we perform a real data driven, multi-scale, full source-to-site, physics based simulation based on the discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method, which allows to precisely validate the ground motion experienced along the Tahtalı dam, comparing the synthetic seismograms against actually observed ones. A comparison with a more classical computational method, using a plane wave with data from a deconvolved seismogram reading as an input, is discussed.}

ABSTRACT={This study provides a lithospheric-scale model along the Ionian Subduction zone in Southern Italy, contributing to the seismotectonic investigation of a region which is affected by relevant historical seismicity. The study employs gravity forward modelling to build the geo-structural model along a composite, NW-SE trending transect extending from the Ionian to the Tyrrhenian Sea, including the Aeolian arc and the Calabro-Peloritan onshore. Through a multidisciplinary approach, we propose new interpretations of three 2D deep-seismic reflection profiles across the study area. Such interpretative profiles are used as constraints to model the observed Bouguer gravity anomalies providing upper and lower crust geometries. Whilst a tomographic model provides constraints for the lithospheric and asthenospheric modelling. The entire workflow is constrained by literature data about Moho geometry, deep seismicity and tomographic images that are integrated to determine the subducting slab geometry. The proposed model of the entire subducting system reasonably fits the observed gravity field and is coherent with the first-order geological and geophysical constraints. The modelling results in updated Tyrrhenian and Ionian Moho depth, subducting slab geometry and location, and densities of the main units, providing valuable input about the composition and geometry of the Calabrian arc structures.}}

abstract={Modelling the response of seismic wavefields to sharp lateral variations in crustal discontinuities is essential for seismic tomography application and path effects correction in earthquake source characterization. This is particularly relevant when wavefields cross back-arc oceanic basins, i.e. mixed continental-oceanic settings. High-frequency (>0.05 Hz) seismic waves resonate and get absorbed across these settings due to a shallow Moho, crustal heterogeneities, and energy leakage. Here, we provide the first high-frequency wave-equation model of full seismograms propagating through realistic 3D back-arc basins. Inversion by parameters trial based on correlation analyses identifies P-, S- and coda-wave as attributes able to estimate jointly 3D Moho variations, sediment thickness, and earthquake source characteristics using data from a single regional earthquake. We use as data waveforms produced by the Accumoli earthquake (Central Italy, 2016), propagating across the Southern Tyrrhenian basin and recorded across Southern Italy. The best model comprises a deep Moho ({\$}{\$}{\backslash}sim{\$}{\$}18 km) in the middle of the basin and a crustal pinch with the continental crust in Sicily. The deep Moho corresponds to the Issel Bridge, a portion of continental crust trapped between the Vavilov and Marsili volcanic centres. The Accumoli earthquake is optimally described at a depth of 7.3 km using a boxcar with rise time of 6 s. Our results show that the early S-wave coda comprises trapped and reverberating phases sensitive to crustal interfaces. Forward modelling these waves is computationally expensive; however, adding these attributes to tomographic procedures allows modelling both source and structural parameters across oceanic basins.},

abstract={The 2016 Mw 6.8 Chauk, Myanmar earthquake was one of the largest earthquakes in Myanmar, leading to significant damage to historical monuments and the first earthquake to occur in the instrumental era. In the current study, broadband (0.01--25 Hz) ground motions are simulated in the 4.5 by 4.5 region around the epicenter to investigate the ground-motion characteristics of the event. Towards this goal, deterministically generated low-frequency and stochastically simulated high-frequency ground motions are combined to create three-component broadband seismograms. The simulated ground motions are further compared with the available strong motion data recorded in the near-field and far-field stations. Thus, the efficacy in modeling the ground motions is quantified through the estimation of the goodness of fit between the 5 \% damped acceleration response spectra obtained from recorded and simulated ground motions. Furthermore, the peak ground acceleration (PGA) of the simulated ground motions for the entire region is presented in the form of a contour map along with its spatial variation with the region's topography. The simulated PGA is further compared with the global ground motion models developed for subduction zone intraslab earthquakes. Most importantly, acceleration time histories are generated at the locations of severely damaged monuments in Bagan and Nyuang-U city, which can further be utilized for nonlinear dynamic analysis of the structures.},

Evaluation of elastic coefficients, material microstructures, morphological features, and related mechanical properties are all part of the process of characterizing a material. Ultrasonic signals are sensitive to material properties such as wave speeds, attenuation, diffusion backscattering, microstructural variation, and elastic characteristics (e.g., elastic modulus, hardness, etc.). Ultrasonic computed tomography (USCT) is an emerging imaging method that can be implemented to obtain a quantitative estimation of material properties. In this study, a source estimation technique was initially proposed to obtain the source time function for accurate forward modeling by constructing a linear inverse problem for the unknown transducer modeling. Finally, a material characterization approach was proposed with accurate source estimation to extract wave speed distribution from an elastic material by employing a wave-based method, known as full waveform inversion (FWI). Systematic performance analysis of the proposed FWI model with accurate source estimation was assessed using experimental and synthetic data obtained from a 6061 aluminum sample. Overall, the proposed FWI technique has successfully reconstructed the wave speed distribution, exhibiting the potential of the proposed method of material characterization in various engineering applications.}
