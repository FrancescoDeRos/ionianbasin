# ionianbasin
This repository collects all material related to my master's thesis work for the Ionian basin region.

It includes:

    Complete simulation setup files (SPECFEM3D Cartesian)

    Parameter files (Par_file, CMTSOLUTION, STATIONS etc.)

    Meshing and model-building utilities

    Post-processing and plotting scripts

    Documentation and notes on simulation parameters and workflow

The aim is to maintain a reproducible and transparent archive of the numerical tests conducted for regional waveform modeling studies.
